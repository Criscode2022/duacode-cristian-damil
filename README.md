This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.8.

## Libraries used

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS Animated](https://www.tailwindcss-animated.com/)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/)

## Development server

First, clone the repository using this command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Criscode2022/duacode-cristian-damil.git
```

Then, navigate to the folder:

```bash
cd duacode-cristian-damil
```

After that, install Node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, to start a local development server run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
